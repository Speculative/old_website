I finally got around to finishing off my website redesign. I started over
winter break, but got stuck on Jekyll integration for Github Pages. I had some
free time so I decided to polish it off. I'm pretty pleased with how it's
turned out, particularly in color and layout. It took a week or two of playing
with Kuler and Subtle Patterns before I finally settled on something that
didn't make my eyes bleed.

I think it's turned out pretty well!
